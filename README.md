# EOA HP/Multiverse Portfolio Project

## Project Overview
This project is a portfolio of work completed throughout the HP / Multiverse apprenticeship. It includes all projects that have been completed during the following Multiverse modules:
    1. SWE Front End Module
    2. SWE Back End Module
    3. SWE Deployment Module
    4. SWE Cyber Security Module

>__note__: This doesn't include all work completed during the apprenticeship, but only work that showcases multiple necessary skills to complete the apprenticeship.

On top of these projects, I will also include other sections in this portfolio that include other projects I've completed outside of this apprenticeship and other relevant work experience.
